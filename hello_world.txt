Let's start again!
Adding this line to remember how to commit from yesterday. (And I guess from years before)
Completely forgot what was in the repot and what wasnt. I was adding this to the practice html file:
    <p>I am trying to remember daily how to commit, while going to school and learning several other things. This text 
        is just another edit to this file so I can try to remember the commands and order.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>git add 'file'</li>
        <li>git commit -m "message"</li>
        <li>git push</li>
    </ol>

It seems like my little commit chart is fully green interestingly enough, even though all I did was add some text to this.
I did find a link to read about my contribution graph as well. https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-settings-on-your-profile/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile
I saw that it is not based on local time, of which I'm EST. So now I will push this after midnight just to see. 

Something weird just happened that caused an error. I tried what I thought would work, git init, and then tried to add then push.
It gave me an error or something where it said end quote, then I ended up in a different folder. I'll see if I can replicate this for 
Science... and learning... and stuff. 

Downloaded the dog image and renamed it with mv which I still think is kind of interesting, even if super basic. 
Can I move and rename at the same time though? I'll have to give it a try. 

I'm curious as to why we aren't saving the website stuff in the repo but it will probably come shortly. Looking forward to diving into TOP again this weekend. 

Alt attribute to describe images for accessibility. 

I never realized that the height and width are useful for the page not to jump around. I always found that very
annoying when websites do that, and now I realize how to fix it if mine ever does. 

Trying to figure out something with commits, learning by doing since search results didn't yield anything super useful.

Notes: Check out github PK, look up sand falling physics/snow falling, sand simulator, other old sims. Could be fun. 
Old gems like the knot one and others that came on the old dell circa 2k. 
Classic projects: Pong, Asteroids, Space Invaders... etc. Other atari/arcade cabinet things. 
Hopefully the snow won't knock out the power tomorrow. 

Winter storm is over. For my portfolio:us
Glenn's website, Halo's rec, BMSAV

With what I learn from TOP and school, I should be able to redo these or start in the second case.

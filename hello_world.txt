Let's start again!
Adding this line to remember how to commit from yesterday. (And I guess from years before)
Completely forgot what was in the repot and what wasnt. I was adding this to the practice html file:
    <p>I am trying to remember daily how to commit, while going to school and learning several other things. This text 
        is just another edit to this file so I can try to remember the commands and order.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>git add 'file'</li>
        <li>git commit -m "message"</li>
        <li>git push</li>
    </ol>

It seems like my little commit chart is fully green interestingly enough, even though all I did was add some text to this.
I did find a link to read about my contribution graph as well. https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-settings-on-your-profile/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile
I saw that it is not based on local time, of which I'm EST. So now I will push this after midnight just to see.
